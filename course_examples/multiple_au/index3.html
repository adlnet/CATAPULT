        <h2>Plate tectonics</h2>
        <p>In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost
            portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming,
            solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. This theory is supported by several types of
            observations, including seafloor spreading and the global distribution of mountain terrain and
            seismicity.</p>
        <p>There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the
            mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by the bulk movement of molecules within fluids). Thus, oceanic
            plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction – because the oceanic
            lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling
            between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate
            tectonics.</p>
        <p>The development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth.
            Long linear regions of geologic features are explained as plate boundaries.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, are seen as
                divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart.
            </li>
            <li>Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts, or
                moves, under another.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas Fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes.
            Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which
            the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force
            for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the
            theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of
            how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.</p>

        <p>Advances in seismology, computer modeling, and mineralogy and crystallography at high temperatures and
            pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.</p>
        <p>Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early
            advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to
            propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the
            Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic
            discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently,
            seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a
            doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the
            Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.</p>
        <p>Mineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modeling studies
            alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental
            settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated
            with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in
            the inner core of the Earth.</p>
