        <p>Geology (from the Ancient Greek γῆ, gē ("earth") and -λoγία, -logia, ("study of", "discourse")) is an
            Earth science concerned with the solid Earth, the rocks of which it is composed, and the processes by which
            they change over time. Geology can also include the study of the solid features of any terrestrial planet or
            natural satellite such as Mars or the Moon. Modern geology significantly overlaps all other Earth sciences,
            including hydrology and the atmospheric sciences, and so is treated as one major aspect of integrated Earth
            system science and planetary science.</p>

        <p>Geology describes the structure of the Earth on and beneath its surface, and the processes that have shaped
            that structure. It also provides tools to determine the relative and absolute ages of rocks found in a given
            location, and also to describe the histories of those rocks. By combining these tools, geologists are
            able to chronicle the geological history of the Earth as a whole, and also to demonstrate the age of the
            Earth. Geology provides the primary evidence for plate tectonics, the evolutionary history of life, and the
            Earth's past climates.
        </p>

        <p>
            Geologists use a wide variety of methods to understand the Earth's structure and evolution, including field
            work, rock description, geophysical techniques, chemical analysis, physical experiments, and numerical
            modelling. In practical terms, geology is important for mineral and hydrocarbon exploration and
            exploitation, evaluating water resources, understanding of natural hazards, the remediation of environmental
            problems, and providing insights into past climate change. Geology is a major academic discipline, and it
            plays an important role in geotechnical engineering.

        Geologic Materials

    </div>
    <div class="body-content">
        <h2>Geologic Materials</h2>

        <p>The majority of geological data comes from research on solid Earth materials. These typically fall into one
            of two categories: rock and unlithified material.</p>

        <h3>Rock</h3>

        <p>The majority of research in geology is associated with the study of rock, as rock provides the primary record
            of the majority of the geologic history of the Earth. There are three major types of rock: igneous,
            sedimentary, and metamorphic. The rock cycle illustrates the relationships among them (see diagram).</p>

        <div class="bodyimg" style="background-image: url('img/cycle1.jpg')">
            <img src="img/cycle1.jpg" alt="cycle1.jpg" role="img">
        </div>

        <p>When a rock solidifies or crystallizes from melt (magma or lava), it is an igneous rock. This rock can be
            weathered and eroded, then redeposited and lithified into a sedimentary rock. It can then be turned into a
            metamorphic rock by heat and pressure that change its mineral content, resulting in a characteristic fabric.
            All three types may melt again, and when this happens, new magma is formed, from which an igneous rock may
            once more solidify.</p>

        <h4>Tests</h4>

        <p>To study all three types of rock, geologists evaluate the minerals of which they are composed. Each mineral
            has distinct physical properties, and there are many tests to determine each of them. The specimens can be
            tested for:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Luster: Quality of light reflected from the surface of a mineral. Examples are metallic, pearly, waxy,
                dull.
            </li>
            <li>Color: Minerals are grouped by their color. Mostly diagnostic but impurities can change a mineral's
                color.
            </li>
            <li>Streak: Performed by scratching the sample on a porcelain plate. The color of the streak can help name
                the mineral.
            </li>
            <li>Hardness: The resistance of a mineral to scratching.</li>
            <li>Breakage pattern: A mineral can either show fracture or cleavage, the former being breakage of uneven
                surfaces, and the latter a breakage along closely spaced parallel planes.
            </li>
            <li>Specific gravity: the weight of a specific volume of a mineral.</li>
            <li>Effervescence: Involves dripping hydrochloric acid on the mineral to test for fizzing.</li>
            <li>Magnetism: Involves using a magnet to test for magnetism.</li>
            <li>Taste: Minerals can have a distinctive taste, such as halite (which tastes like table salt).</li>
            <li>Smell: Minerals can have a distinctive odor. For example, sulfur smells like rotten eggs.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>Unlithified material</h3>
        <p>Geologists also study unlithified materials (referred to as drift), which typically come from more recent
            deposits. These materials are superficial deposits that lie above the bedrock. This study is often known
            as Quaternary geology, after the Quaternary period of geologic history.</p>

        <h4>Magma</h4>
        <p>However, unlithified material does not only include sediments. Magma is the original unlithified source of
            all igneous rocks. The active flow of molten rock is closely studied in volcanology, and igneous petrology
            aims to determine the history of igneous rocks from their final crystallization to their original molten
            source.</p>

        <h2>Plate tectonics</h2>
        <p>In the 1960s, it was discovered that the Earth's lithosphere, which includes the crust and rigid uppermost
            portion of the upper mantle, is separated into tectonic plates that move across the plastically deforming,
            solid, upper mantle, which is called the asthenosphere. This theory is supported by several types of
            observations, including seafloor spreading and the global distribution of mountain terrain and
            seismicity.</p>
        <p>There is an intimate coupling between the movement of the plates on the surface and the convection of the
            mantle (that is, the heat transfer caused by the bulk movement of molecules within fluids). Thus, oceanic
            plates and the adjoining mantle convection currents always move in the same direction – because the oceanic
            lithosphere is actually the rigid upper thermal boundary layer of the convecting mantle. This coupling
            between rigid plates moving on the surface of the Earth and the convecting mantle is called plate
            tectonics.</p>
        <p>The development of plate tectonics has provided a physical basis for many observations of the solid Earth.
            Long linear regions of geologic features are explained as plate boundaries.</p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Mid-ocean ridges, high regions on the seafloor where hydrothermal vents and volcanoes exist, are seen as
                divergent boundaries, where two plates move apart.
            </li>
            <li>Arcs of volcanoes and earthquakes are theorized as convergent boundaries, where one plate subducts, or
                moves, under another.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>Transform boundaries, such as the San Andreas Fault system, resulted in widespread powerful earthquakes.
            Plate tectonics also has provided a mechanism for Alfred Wegener's theory of continental drift, in which
            the continents move across the surface of the Earth over geologic time. They also provided a driving force
            for crustal deformation, and a new setting for the observations of structural geology. The power of the
            theory of plate tectonics lies in its ability to combine all of these observations into a single theory of
            how the lithosphere moves over the convecting mantle.</p>

        <p>Advances in seismology, computer modeling, and mineralogy and crystallography at high temperatures and
            pressures give insights into the internal composition and structure of the Earth.</p>
        <p>Seismologists can use the arrival times of seismic waves in reverse to image the interior of the Earth. Early
            advances in this field showed the existence of a liquid outer core (where shear waves were not able to
            propagate) and a dense solid inner core. These advances led to the development of a layered model of the
            Earth, with a crust and lithosphere on top, the mantle below (separated within itself by seismic
            discontinuities at 410 and 660 kilometers), and the outer core and inner core below that. More recently,
            seismologists have been able to create detailed images of wave speeds inside the earth in the same way a
            doctor images a body in a CT scan. These images have led to a much more detailed view of the interior of the
            Earth, and have replaced the simplified layered model with a much more dynamic model.</p>
        <p>Mineralogists have been able to use the pressure and temperature data from the seismic and modeling studies
            alongside knowledge of the elemental composition of the Earth to reproduce these conditions in experimental
            settings and measure changes in crystal structure. These studies explain the chemical changes associated
            with the major seismic discontinuities in the mantle and show the crystallographic structures expected in
            the inner core of the Earth.</p>

            dates of the first Solar System material at 4.567 Ga (or 4.567 billion years ago) and the formation of
            the Earth at 4.54 Ga (4.54 billion years), which is the beginning of the informally recognized
            Hadean eon – a division of geological time. At the later end of the scale, it is marked by the present day
            (in the Holocene epoch).</p>
        <h2>Timescale of the Earth</h2>
        <p>The following five timelines show the geologic time scale. The first shows the entire time from the formation
            of the Earth to the present, but this gives little space for the most recent eon. Therefore, the second
            timeline shows an expanded view of the most recent eon. In a similar way, the most recent era is expanded in
            the third timeline, the most recent period is expanded in the fourth timeline, and the most recent epoch is
            expanded in the fifth timeline.</p>

    <div class="title">
        Dating Methods
        <div class="titleunderbar"></div>
    </div>
    <div class="body-content">
        <h2>Relative dating</h2>
        <p>Methods for relative dating were developed when geology first emerged as a natural science. Geologists still
            use the following principles today as a means to provide information about geological history and the timing
            of geological events.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of uniformitarianism states that the geological processes observed in operation that modify the
            Earth's crust at present have worked in much the same way over geological time. A fundamental principle
            of geology advanced by the 18th-century Scottish physician and geologist James Hutton is that "the present
            is the key to the past." In Hutton's words: "the past history of our globe must be explained by what can be
            seen to be happening now."
        </p>
        <p>The principle of intrusive relationships concerns crosscutting intrusions. In geology, when an igneous
            intrusion cuts across a formation of sedimentary rock, it can be determined that the igneous intrusion is
            younger than the sedimentary rock. Different types of intrusions include stocks, laccoliths, batholiths,
            sills and dikes.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of cross-cutting relationships pertains to the formation of faults and the age of the sequences
            through which they cut. Faults are younger than the rocks they cut; accordingly, if a fault is found that
            penetrates some formations but not those on top of it, then the formations that were cut are older than the
            fault, and the ones that are not cut must be younger than the fault. Finding the key bed in these situations
            may help determine whether the fault is a normal fault or a thrust fault.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of inclusions and components states that, with sedimentary rocks, if inclusions (or clasts) are
            found in a formation, then the inclusions must be older than the formation that contains them. For example,
            in sedimentary rocks, it is common for gravel from an older formation to be ripped up and included in a
            newer layer. A similar situation with igneous rocks occurs when xenoliths are found. These foreign bodies
            are picked up as magma or lava flows, and are incorporated, later to cool in the matrix. As a result,
            xenoliths are older than the rock that contains them.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of original horizontality states that the deposition of sediments occurs as essentially
            horizontal beds. Observation of modern marine and non-marine sediments in a wide variety of environments
            supports this generalization (although cross-bedding is inclined, the overall orientation of cross-bedded
            units is horizontal).
        </p>
        <p>The principle of superposition states that a sedimentary rock layer in a tectonically undisturbed sequence is
            younger than the one beneath it and older than the one above it. Logically a younger layer cannot slip
            beneath a layer previously deposited. This principle allows sedimentary layers to be viewed as a form of the
            vertical timeline, a partial or complete record of the time elapsed from deposition of the lowest layer to
            deposition of the highest bed.
        </p>
        <p>The principle of faunal succession is based on the appearance of fossils in sedimentary rocks. As organisms
            exist during the same period throughout the world, their presence or (sometimes) absence provides a relative
            age of the formations where they appear. Based on principles that William Smith laid out almost a hundred
            years before the publication of Charles Darwin's theory of evolution, the principles of succession developed
            independently of evolutionary thought. The principle becomes quite complex, however, given the uncertainties
            of fossilization, localization of fossil types due to lateral changes in habitat (facies change in
            sedimentary strata), and that not all fossils formed globally at the same time.
        </p>

            <img src="img/utahstrat.jpg" alt="utahstrat.jpg" role="img">
        </div>

        <h2>Absolute dating</h2>
        <p>Geologists also use methods to determine the absolute age of rock samples and geological events. These dates
            are useful on their own and may also be used in conjunction with relative dating methods or to calibrate
            relative methods.
        </p>
        <p>At the beginning of the 20th century, advancement in geological science was facilitated by the ability to
            obtain accurate absolute dates to geological events using radioactive isotopes and other methods. This
            changed the understanding of geological time. Previously, geologists could only use fossils and
            stratigraphic correlation to date sections of rock relative to one another. With isotopic dates, it became
            possible to assign absolute ages to rock units, and these absolute dates could be applied to fossil
            sequences in which there was datable material, converting the old relative ages into new absolute ages.
        </p>
        <p>For many geological applications, isotope ratios of radioactive elements are measured in minerals that give
            the amount of time that has passed since a rock passed through its particular closure temperature, the point
            at which different radiometric isotopes stop diffusing into and out of the crystal lattice. These
            are used in geochronologic and thermochronologic studies. Common methods include uranium–lead dating,
            potassium–argon dating, argon–argon dating and uranium–thorium dating. These methods are used for a variety
            of applications. Dating of lava and volcanic ash layers found within a stratigraphic sequence can provide
            absolute age data for sedimentary rock units that do not contain radioactive isotopes and calibrate relative
            dating techniques. These methods can also be used to determine ages of pluton emplacement. Thermochemical
            techniques can be used to determine temperature profiles within the crust, the uplift of mountain ranges,
            and paleo-topography.
        </p>
        <p>Fractionation of the lanthanide series elements is used to compute ages since rocks were removed from the
            mantle.
        </p>
        <p>Other methods are used for more recent events. Optically stimulated luminescence and cosmogenic radionuclide
            dating are used to date surfaces and/or erosion rates. Dendrochronology can also be used for the dating of
            landscapes. Radiocarbon dating is used for geologically young materials containing organic carbon.</p>

        Geological Development of an Area

    </div>
    <div class="body-content">
        <p>The geology of an area changes through time as rock units are deposited and inserted, and deformational
            processes change their shapes and locations.
        </p>
        <p>Rock units are first emplaced either by deposition onto the surface or intrusion into the overlying rock.
            Deposition can occur when sediments settle onto the surface of the Earth and later lithify into sedimentary
            rock, or when as volcanic material such as volcanic ash or lava flows blanket the surface. Igneous
            intrusions such as batholiths, laccoliths, dikes, and sills, push upwards into the overlying rock, and
            crystallize as they intrude.
        </p>
        <p>After the initial sequence of rocks has been deposited, the rock units can be deformed and/or metamorphosed.
            Deformation typically occurs as a result of horizontal shortening, horizontal extension, or side-to-side
            (strike-slip) motion. These structural regimes broadly relate to convergent boundaries, divergent
            boundaries, and transform boundaries, respectively, between tectonic plates.
        </p>

        <img width="33%" src="img/fault_types.svg" alt="fault_types.svg" role="img" align="left"
             style="padding-right: 10px">

        <p>When rock units are placed under horizontal compression, they shorten and become thicker. Because rock units,
            other than muds, do not significantly change in volume, this is accomplished in two primary ways: through
            faulting and folding. In the shallow crust, where brittle deformation can occur, thrust faults form, which
            causes the deeper rock to move on top of the shallower rock. Because deeper rock is often older, as noted by
            the principle of superposition, this can result in older rocks moving on top of younger ones. Movement along
            faults can result in folding, either because the faults are not planar or because rock layers are dragged
            along, forming drag folds as slip occurs along the fault. Deeper in the Earth, rocks behave plastically and
            fold instead of faulting. These folds can either be those where the material in the center of the fold
            buckles upwards, creating "antiforms", or where it buckles downwards, creating "synforms". If the tops of
            the rock units within the folds remain pointing upwards, they are called anticlines and synclines,
            respectively. If some of the units in the fold are facing downward, the structure is called an overturned
            anticline or syncline, and if all of the rock units are overturned or the correct up-direction is unknown,
            they are simply called by the most general terms, antiforms, and synforms.
        </p>
        <p>Even higher pressures and temperatures during horizontal shortening can cause both folding and metamorphism
            of the rocks. This metamorphism causes changes in the mineral composition of the rocks; creates a foliation,
            or planar surface, that is related to mineral growth under stress. This can remove signs of the original
            textures of the rocks, such as bedding in sedimentary rocks, flow features of lavas, and crystal patterns in
            crystalline rocks.
        </p>
        <p>Extension causes the rock units as a whole to become longer and thinner. This is primarily accomplished
            through normal faulting and through the ductile stretching and thinning. Normal faults drop rock units that
            are higher below those that are lower. This typically results in younger units ending up below older units.
            Stretching of units can result in their thinning. In fact, at one location within the Maria Fold and Thrust
            Belt, the entire sedimentary sequence of the Grand Canyon appears over a length of less than a meter. Rocks
            at the depth to be ductilely stretched are often also metamorphosed. These stretched rocks can also pinch
            into lenses, known as boudins, after the French word for "sausage" because of their visual similarity.
        </p>
        <p>Where rock units slide past one another, strike-slip faults develop in shallow regions, and become shear
            zones at deeper depths where the rocks deform ductilely.
        </p>
        <p>The addition of new rock units, both depositionally and intrusively, often occurs during deformation.
            Faulting and other deformational processes result in the creation of topographic gradients, causing material
            on the rock unit that is increasing in elevation to be eroded by hillslopes and channels. These sediments
            are deposited on the rock unit that is going down. Continual motion along the fault maintains the
            topographic gradient in spite of the movement of sediment and continues to create accommodation space for
            the material to deposit. Deformational events are often also associated with volcanism and igneous activity.
            Volcanic ashes and lavas accumulate on the surface, and igneous intrusions enter from below. Dikes, long,
            planar igneous intrusions, enter along cracks, and therefore often form in large numbers in areas that are
            being actively deformed. This can result in the emplacement of dike swarms, such as those that are
            observable across the Canadian shield, or rings of dikes around the lava tube of a volcano.
        </p>
        <p>All of these processes do not necessarily occur in a single environment and do not necessarily occur in a
            single order. The Hawaiian Islands, for example, consist almost entirely of layered basaltic lava flows. The
            sedimentary sequences of the mid-continental United States and the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United
            States contain almost-undeformed stacks of sedimentary rocks that have remained in place since Cambrian
            time. Other areas are much more geologically complex. In the southwestern United States, sedimentary,
            volcanic, and intrusive rocks have been metamorphosed, faulted, foliated, and folded. Even older rocks, such
            as the Acasta gneiss of the Slave craton in northwestern Canada, the oldest known rock in the world have
            been metamorphosed to the point where their origin is indiscernible without laboratory analysis. In
            addition, these processes can occur in stages. In many places, the Grand Canyon in the southwestern United
            States being a very visible example, the lower rock units were metamorphosed and deformed, and then
            deformation ended and the upper, undeformed units were deposited. Although any amount of rock emplacement
            and rock deformation can occur, and they can occur any number of times, these concepts provide a guide to
            understanding the geological history of an area.</p>

        <h2>Economic geology</h2>
        <p>Economic geology is a branch of geology that deals with aspects of economic minerals that humankind uses to
            fulfill various needs. Economic minerals are those extracted profitably for various practical uses. Economic
            geologists help locate and manage the Earth's natural resources, such as petroleum and coal, as well as
            mineral resources, which include metals such as iron, copper, and uranium.</p>

        <h2>Mining geology</h2>
        <p>Mining geology consists of the extractions of mineral resources from the Earth. Some resources of economic
            interests include gemstones, metals such as gold and copper, and many minerals such as asbestos, perlite,
            mica, phosphates, zeolites, clay, pumice, quartz, and silica, as well as elements such as sulfur, chlorine,
            and helium.</p>

        <h2>Petroleum geology</h2>
        <p>Petroleum geologists study the locations of the subsurface of the Earth that can contain extractable
            hydrocarbons, especially petroleum and natural gas. Because many of these reservoirs are found in
            sedimentary basins, they study the formation of these basins, as well as their sedimentary and tectonic
            evolution and the present-day positions of the rock units.</p>

        <h2>Engineering geology</h2>
        <p>Engineering geology is the application of geological principles to engineering practice for the purpose of
            assuring that the geological factors affecting the location, design, construction, operation, and
            maintenance of engineering works are properly addressed.</p>
        <p>In the field of civil engineering, geological principles and analyses are used in order to ascertain the
            mechanical principles of the material on which structures are built. This allows tunnels to be built without
            collapsing, bridges and skyscrapers to be built with sturdy foundations, and buildings to be built that will
            not settle in clay and mud.</p>

        <h2>Hydrology and environmental issues</h2>
        <p>Geology and geological principles can be applied to various environmental problems such as stream
            restoration, the restoration of brownfields, and the understanding of the interaction between natural
            habitat and the geological environment. Groundwater hydrology, or hydrogeology, is used to locate
            groundwater, which can often provide a ready supply of uncontaminated water and is especially important
            in arid regions, and to monitor the spread of contaminants in groundwater wells.</p>
        <p>Geologists also obtain data through stratigraphy, boreholes, core samples, and ice cores. Ice cores and
            sediment cores are used for paleoclimate reconstructions, which tell geologists about past and present
            temperature, precipitation, and sea level across the globe. These datasets are our primary source of
            information on global climate change outside of instrumental data.</p>

        <h2>Natural hazards</h2>
        <p>Geologists and geophysicists study natural hazards in order to enact safe building codes and warning systems
            that are used to prevent loss of property and life. Examples of important natural hazards that are pertinent
            to geology (as opposed those that are mainly or only pertinent to meteorology) are:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Avalanches</li>
            <li>Earthquakes</li>
            <li>Floods</li>
            <li>Landslides and debris flows</li>
            <li>River channel migration and avulsion</li>
            <li>Rockfalls</li>
            <li>Sinkholes</li>
            <li>Soil liquefaction</li>
            <li>Subsidence</li>
            <li>Tsunamis</li>
            <li>Volcanoes</li>
