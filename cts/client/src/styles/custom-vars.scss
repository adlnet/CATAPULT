// Accessibility tweaks:
// - According to the Bootstrap docs[1], the colors in the default palette lead
//   to insufficient contrast for WCAG 2.0 guidelines when used against a light
//   background. Since our colors aren't too far off from the defaults, we may
//   have to adjust some of the color scaling values to compensate.
//
// - Make sure that links are always underlined[2]. Otherwise, we'd need to
//   ensure that there is a 3:1 contrast between body text and link text, on
//   top of the standard 4.5:1 text contrast requirement. And we'd have to add
//   an underline on hover or mouse focus anyway.
